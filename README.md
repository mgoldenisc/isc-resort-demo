# Foreign Tables Demo
## Global Summit 2023 - Demos and Drinks

This repository contains a demo of the new Foreign Tables feature, introduced as an experimental feature with IRIS 2023.1. Note that you'll need Docker to get started, so make sure you've got the Docker engine installed!

## Running with Docker

First clone the repository locally, then to get started simply run:

```
docker compose build
